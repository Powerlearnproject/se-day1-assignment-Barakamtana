#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process developing solution for problems in  the realworld using computer technology.

It's importance is it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life example in ecommerce and entertainment industry

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The coming up of software engineering as a discipline reflecting the growing need for a systematic approach to software development.
2.AI technologies have made it easier to write and debug code
3.Develpment of GUI's have have made development and making software more user-friendly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements stage which invloves gathering and docummentation user need and system requirements
2.Software Design which involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation which is the technical part of the software development life cycle it involves actual writing of code and building software
4.Tesing - it involves conducting tests to softwaree meet standard and function requirements
5.Software deploment - which is releasing the software to users
6.Software maintainance -which is providing ongoing support, updates, enhancements and removing unwantes features to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method - Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. 
Agile method -Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- responsible of writing actual code and development of the software and maintaining software
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software meets quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - IDE help software developers with comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code 
 Version Control Systems - are important for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members 
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.

strategies to overcome these challenges include 
1.Effective communication
2.Agile methodologies
3.Prioritization of tasks
4.Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective prompts to guide language models like ChatGPT.
Importance in interacting with AI models include but not limited to:
1.AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and creative endeavors.
2. In data analysis AI can analyze large datasets quickly and accurately, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
